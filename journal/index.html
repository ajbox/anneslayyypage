        <h2>My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?</h2>
        <h3>Laurel Schwulst</h3>

        <p>I remember thinking that this reading reminded me of moving. Because of the section about the website as a room. Coding is similar to moving because you have the same set of items but you can arrange them in a different way evertime you move/make a new website.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>A Handmade Web</h2>
        <h3>J.R. Carpenter</h3>
        <br>
        <p>I didn't have that many thought about this reading because its pretty comprehensive but I like how many sources there are and that theyre all linked so you can click on them and actually read them. I feel like when you read articles they usually just mention things as if you're supposed to know their referenced material off hand.</p>

        <h2>Hello World!</h2>
        <h3>Taeyoon Choi</h3>
        <br>
        <p>I really like that some of the text is drawn and some is typed it kind of helps with the followability of the reading. I enjoy the section about the fisr computers being human. When I read this for the first time it reminded me about how AI was essentially coded by someone somewhere but people think AI is some sort of computer being that's doing things without being influenced by their code.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>A Friend is Writing</h2>
        <h3>Callum Copley</h3>
        <br>
        <p>I like the commentary on how the work life balance line is essentially blurring. But I dont like the website. I think that it's hard to know what the topic is and if im reading I just want to read and not slueth. But if my goal in life was to sleuth I would love this. It also takes a while for the site to populate and I wish there was a button so the site would just populate quickly</p>
        <br>

        <h2>The Good Room</h2>
        <h3>Frank Chimero</h3>
        <p>I think I contributed many thoughts to the discussion, but the moral of this story is that you should never write about something's physical state definitively because things change over time. And you never know when you'll write "this vcu building is abandoned" without a date and the building is rebuilt the next day and then what you wrote is just innacurate to society. The rest of the reading is slay.
