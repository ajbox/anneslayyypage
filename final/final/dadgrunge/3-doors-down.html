        <h1>3 Doors Down</h1>
        <p>3 Doors Down is an American rock band from Escatawpa, Mississippi, formed in 1996. The band originally consisted of Brad Arnold (lead vocals, drums), Matt Roberts (lead guitar, backing vocals), and Todd Harrell (bass guitar); Chris Henderson (rhythm guitar) later joined the band in 1998. The band rose to international fame with their 2000 debut single, "Kryptonite", which peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 and led them to sign with Universal Records. It was followed by their debut studio album, The Better Life (2000), which became the 11th-best-selling album of that year and received septuple platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The group was later joined by drummer Richard Liles, who played during the tour for their first album.</p>
