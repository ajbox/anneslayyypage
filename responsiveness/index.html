                        NARRATOR:
                        (Black screen with text; The sound of buzzing bees can be heard)
                        According to all known laws
                        of aviation, there is no way a bee
                        should be able to fly.
                         <br>
                        Its wings are too small to get
                        its fat little body off the ground.
                         <br>
                        The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care
                        what humans think is impossible.
                        <br>

                        Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
                        Yellow, black. Yellow, black.

                        Hang on a second.

                        <br>
                        BARRY:
                        - I can't. I'll pick you up.

                        Use the stairs. Your father
                        paid good money for those.
                        <br>
                        BARRY:

                        JANET:
                        Barry, I told you,
                        stop flying in the house!
                        (Barry drives through the hive,and is waved at by Adam who is reading a
                        newspaper)

                        (Adam gets in Barry's car)
                        - Is that fuzz gel?
                        <br>
                        BARRY:
                        - A little. Special day, graduation.
                        <br>
                        ADAM:
                        Never thought I'd make it.
                        <br>
                        (Barry pulls away from the house and continues driving)

                        Those were awkward.
                        <br>
                        BARRY:
                        Three days college. I'm glad I took
                        a day and hitchhiked around the hive.
                        <br>
                        ADAM:
