            <p>view comments from all over the web and try to guess what the post was about.</p>
            <p>it's helpful to start vague in your guesses like guessing a noun:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"person"</li>
                <li>"place"</li>
                <li>"thing"</li>
            </ul>
            <p>after guessing a noun try to guess an overrall topic such as music, food, sports, etc.</p>
            <p>guessing the platform and type of post may be helpful as well.</p><br>
            <p>finally, answers typically are more than one word and sometimes combine close guessed words</p>
            <p class="warning"> AND REMEMBER, these comments are sometimes related but generally random to the actual post, so get creative while guessing ;) </p>
